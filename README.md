Verilog Modules Collection â€“ Counters, Muxes, and Comparators

This project contains multiple Verilog modules with their respective testbenches and waveform outputs. All designs are written in pure Verilog without any display or peripheral integration. These were created to practice fundamental digital logic design and simulation.

File Descriptions:

1. Mod-7 Asynchronous Counter:
   - Mod7asynchcounter.v       : Verilog code for a mod-7 asynchronous counter.
   - Mod7asynchcounter_tb.v    : Testbench to simulate the counter behavior.
   - Mod7counter.png           : Waveform image showing the counter in action.

2. 4-bit Comparator:
   - comparator.v              : Verilog module to compare two 4-bit numbers.
   - comparator_tb.v           : Testbench covering less than, equal to, and greater than conditions.
   - comparator.png            : Output waveform screenshot.

3. 2-to-1 Multiplexer:
   - mux 2.v                   : Verilog code for a 2:1 multiplexer.
   - mux2_tb.v                 : Testbench to verify mux select and input operation.
   - mux2.png                  : Waveform image for verification.

To run the simulations, use any online Verilog simulator like EDA Playground, or run it locally in VS Code with the Verilog-HDL extension and Icarus Verilog installed.

Each design was made step-by-step and verified using waveforms.
